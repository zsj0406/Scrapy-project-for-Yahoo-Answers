But back then my headaches were much worse and lasted about 4 days until i decided to go to the doctors and they soon cleared up. \r\n \r\nBut this time my headaches seem very dull in the background and are more of an annoyance than a  'pain'. And i've had it for around 6-8 days now, i will go to see the doctors if it's still there on Monday and it's Sunday when i'm writing this. I'm quite worried as i suppose anyone would be and i hate going to see the doctors. Today the dull annoying pain seems to be a lot less than it has previously.  \r\n \r\nBut the weird thing is that the headaches aren't only on one side of my head, it varies and can switch from left to right around the temple area and behind the eye. I've been doing some research online and it could be numerous things such as; \r\n \r\n-Tension headache \r\n-Lack of vitamins \r\n- or something very more serious... \r\n \r\nI have been taking multivitamins for 2 days now hoping that it is because of that, and have stayed off my computer for 2 days as i go on my computer an aweful lot and that could be the reason why.... but it doesn't seem to be that. I have no allergies, but here in England it's supposed to be summer and we've had a lot of rain, which i read could lead to headaches but i doubt this would be my reason as i seem to have the headaches from when i wake up, to when i go to sleep. \r\n \r\nAs i said previously the headaches aren't bad, they are just annoying. Now i know you are going to say that it's best for me to see a doctor, which is what i am going to do but i was wondering if anyone has had this previously and can perhaps shed some light as to what they think it could be as i'm really really nervous and worried! \r\n \r\nThanks for reading and thank you for any responses in advance, \r\nAsh.", "cate": " Pain & Pain Management", "title": "\n            Headache for Over one week now...?\n        "},

They're not debilitating as such, just annoying (the kind that makes you want to hit yourself on the head). So they're not really bad to he point of making me scream in pain.  \r\nThese headaches come and go from time to time and they last for a few days (up to 3/4), but sometimes only last one day. They're not an all-over pain, rather a sort of pin point pain that moves from sometimes being above my eye (normally on the right side) to being at the back of my head by my neck-put your finger on the point where your spine meets your head and move your finger about 2\" to the right, just above the soft bit. They only really occur in those two spots, but can change sides sometimes.  \r\nI don't get any nausea or vomiting,  weakness, numbness, changes in vision or any other senses, fainting etc... Just the headache. \r\nI haven't taken any painkillers for it because I hate taking medicines.  \r\nI've never drunk alcohol regularly (been drunk once, I only drink water, milk and some tea), I've never smoked anything, or taken any drugs, I'm not on any medications. I've recently been heart monitored for palpitations and had a blood count done, all came back fine.  \r\nI'm 17 years old, currently doing A-Levels, which are quite stressful. Plus I get anxious quite a lot about medical conditions (bit of a hypochondriac).  \r\nLast things, I do weightlifting, I have been for about 7 months, and if I do weightlifting or any exercise and I have a headache then it goes away normally. If I also do any other activities, they go away if I have them at the time. And last night I was having a photo shoot done with my girlfriend and the flash from the camera made it flare up a bit.  \r\nSo, just wondering if it sounds serious or not so bad? \r\nAny help greatly appreciated. \r\nThanks :)  \r\nDan \r\n \r\nPS.

{"ques": " I have had repeated headaches over the course of the past two weeks. They're not particularly bad headaches but they're noticeable and always occur in the same part of my head, on the left side forehead. It seems like I have one every other day around either the late afternoon or just before I go to bed. The problem is I can't tell why I'm getting these headaches. \r\n \r\nFirstly, I know it's not from dehydration because my urine has been mostly clear so that's not it. \r\n \r\nIt could be from stress maybe. I'm starting college in three weeks and I am pretty nervous about it so maybe that's it. As a result I haven't been sleeping as well as I usually do. I am normally able to get 7-8 hours of sleep but recently I have only been getting 5-6 hours. Taking into account coffee and soda, I do consume a pretty substantial amount of caffeine during the day but that's just to keep me awake. \r\n \r\nI also got my wisdom teeth removed about two weeks ago. I don't know if the healing process could induce headaches particularly over such a long period of time but if that has anything to do with it someone please let me know. \r\n \r\nOne reason I have also considered is potential cerebral hemorrhaging or a concussion from a punch to the head I sustained about two and a half weeks ago. However, I don't seem to meet the symptoms in this case. People who have these symptoms tend to report that they have the \"worst headache they've ever had in their life,\" and these headaches are definitely not the worst I've ever had. \r\n \r\nBy the way, I am 18, I don't smoke or drink and I work out three times a week so I don't think it could be from high blood pressure or anything like that. \r\n \r\nYour answers are much appreciated.", "cate": " Other - General Health Care", "title": "\n            Why do I have these headaches?\n        "},

I've taken Tylenol before, and I've taken aspirin with caffeine before, but it doesn't touch it. At most, it might prevent it from getting worse? But it doesn't make it better or go away. I'll get headaches practically every day for awhile. Then it'll stop eventually,& I'll go awhile without headaches before they come back. The only things that gets rid of them is sleep (if I can) or an orgasm, haha.
