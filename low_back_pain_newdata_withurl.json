{"ques": " (I'm 16 years old, 5,5, 155 lbs) Well this all started about a year and a half ago. I was out skateboarding with some friends when I felt my back started hurting a little. We kept skating for a few hours. The pain started building up even more so I decided to go home. On my way home my back hurt so much that it hurt too much to walk so I started pedaling as fast as I could ignoring the pain and just wanting to get home. When I got home I told my mom that it hurt to walk and she said she'd take me to some lady that massages people to fix back problems. So I was ok with that and I went downstairs to go to sleep. It hurt the whole way down and when I went to go lay down, I had to lay down on my side because it hurt to lay down on my back or my tummy. My dad called me up stairs so I went up but when I got up their he just told me to stop complaining and to man up. The next day my mom took me to the lady and the whole massage hurt but when we were leaving I could walk a little better. She told me to lay off my back for at least a week. The next day I went to go skate (dumb decision). Going into 10th grade I enrolled in a weightlifting class. Half way into my last semester of that class I was dead-lifting 315 lbs when I felt a sharp pain in my lower back so I dropped the weights. The teacher kept telling me to keep lifting or I'd fail his class. I told this to my dad but he just said to listen to the teacher. I told my mom and she went with me to my school to drop out of that class. Im in the middle of my junior year and im still having all these lower back pain problems. \r\n \r\nSo my question is, What should I do? Should I see a chiropractor?

These injuries were all characterized by a popping noise or sequence followed by pain in the low back. It's never been debilitating pain where I can't stand or sit or lay. It's never travelled to other parts of my body as far as I can tell. Really it's just a nuisance. I wake up and it's always a bit stiff with some minor pain but after I move around it loosens up. It just gets annoying. I cant remember a day where I didn't notice at least some back stiffness or minor pain when bending over, sitting up from laying down, or standing up from a seated position.

I am not overweight I am 5'9'' and I weigh around 140 pounds. I am definitely not in shape though. \r\n \r\nThe combination of asthma, weak ankles, weak back, and laziness have all contributed to my being out of shape.

The best way I can describe is that it felt like someone shot me in the back and the bullet was letting out small electrical impulses from my lower back. I dang near screamed when I felt the sudden pain. It was so bad I practically limped to the nurses office. I was taken home immediatly and I was put on bed rest for next day or so, just giving my back time to relax and try to not feel as much pain. \r\n \r\nI've never had an episode quite nearly as bad as that one, but I've noticed I still get pretty bad back pain every now and again since that incident. It normally happens when I get really stressed out over something or someone. I'm wondering if I should go to the health professional on my college campus and see if I could get an official diagnosis or not. I've never felt tingly sensations down in my knees/legs when I get the back pain, nor do I feel numbness in my legs.

{"ques": " I am a 43 yo female with chronic low back pain.  I have been through MRIs, CTs, Mylorams, sensory and nerve conduction studies, plain x-rays, ultrasounds and physical therapy.  I've had cortizone shots, as well.  My pain began back in 1986 during my first pregnancy.  At 26 I had a partial hysterectomy.  Recently I have had two colonoscopies and surgery to remove my ovaries in which they found an extensive amount of scar tissue and endometriosis -- which was not the reason I had the partial hysterctomy.  Until April 1, 2008, I would experience constant aching in the low back, but only suffered severe bouts about five or six times a year.  On March 31, 2008, I fell flat on my back and have had severe low back pain ever since. \r\nMy symptoms are as follows:  The triangular area at the small of my back will swell enough that I can cup my hand around it.  The SI joint on the left side is very tender.  I have a stinging pain that goes from the SI joint, around my buttocks and left hip, crossing over to my left groin area, down the inner thigh all the way to my toes.  I have severe aching in both my feet.  My left knee will swell twice its normal size.  I often cannot walk or stand because the weight causes the pain to become more severe.  I cannot sleep at night because I can't get comfortable. \r\nThis has always been located on the same side (left) with the same symptoms, although now the symptoms are constant.  The doctors don't seem to be finding anything on any of the tests.  My neurologist said that I have mild L5 nerve root damage, but nothing is compressing the L5 nerve root.  I do have a small disk bulge at that level, but again, not compressing the root on films.  She's the one that found mass that led to surgery and other findings (that didn't show up on films, either!) \r\nI had colonoscopy from severe constipation with extreme gas and bloating, but that came out clear, too, but symptoms still exist.  And I have had some unexplained weight gain, as well.

{"ques": " I am a 23 year old female. I have severe really low back pain that is sometimes crippling. It started about 8 months ago and was only on the right side of my bag. Shooting pains go down my leg. The past 2 or 3 months the pain has gotten even worse(which I didn't think was possible) and now its on both sides of my back. I try and stretch but nothing makes me feel more comfortable. It hurts just as bad standing as it does when I'm sitting or laying. Sometimes in the morning I go to stand up and fall to the ground in pain.  \r\nI either missed or my period is now almost 2 weeks late. This has never happened to me before but I have been very stressed the past few months and just recently moved. I got tested and I am not pregnant. \r\nCan these two problems be somehow connected? Or is the back a totally seperate thing from my missed period, which may be from stress and major changes in my life.

This last summer, I went back packing all over Europe and gradually noticed significant back pain.

Due to the pain, i have lost a great deal of flexibility in my hamstrings. I also experience Tingling in my quad, but not hamstring which eliminates the possibility of some sort of sciatic problem. \n \nCan anyone offer ANY suggestions about ways to possibly heal these symptoms.

My back/neck were severely twisted on landing, to the point where I was nearly paralyzed. Luckily, I was able to walk away but the pain has lasted ever since. \r\n \r\nSince that injury my back pain has kept me from walking very far, no running, standing, etc. I've become very stiff all over as well. The pain is generally in the lower lumbar area where the lower and upper back muscles meet. It is usually dull and throbbing, but becomes stabbing or tearing when I exercise for any length of time (45-60 mins cardio).  \r\n \r\nI have put on a lot of weight since the injury, which isn't helping the back, but then my cardio exercise ability has dropped dramatically. I've had xrays and an MRI and no structural damage has been found. When standing, however, one xray showed my back bowing toward the right side (injury was on the left). I shift weight toward the right when standing too.  \r\n \r\nI've been to a chiropractor but that didn't bring lasting results. I do some yoga positions to stretch it out but the pain still persists.

Also, sometimes when I turn my head towards the area with the MOST pain (left) it seems to aggravate it more as well.  \r\nLaying down in the fetal position with my feet on a pillow seems to relieve it some, as does taking a hot shower or cracking my back, but the relief never lasts and returns within minutes. \r\n \r\nIdeas? Questions? Comments? \r\n \r\nWhat I'm looking for is answers describing what you might think could be the cause, as we all know that SOMETIMES, our doctors need a small nudge in the right direction (I went to a doctor for years complaining of frequent highs and lows in mood and energy, as well as sleepiness and nausea before suggesting to my doctor the need for a blood test to rule out diabetes, which it turns out was one of the major factors in my symptoms) \r\n \r\nAny comments are appreciated.", "link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100323151722AANWsKh", "cate": " Injuries", "title": "\n            Extreme lower back pain?\n        "},

Just 6 months after I had my first daugter I started feeling a pain on my coccyx or tailbone, Then, all of a sudden I felt like someone was stabbing me in my lower back, in fact the pain was so horrible I literally couldn't move> my family had to take me to the emergency and let me tell you the pain was so bad that I thought my back was broken, in the ride to the hospital I almost fainted, Any movement was absolutely excruciating. Once we entered the emergency room, the doctors inmediately took me to the X-ray room and all because of my screaming, lol. After that they gave me morphine and believe it or not it did not take the pain away as much. The results came in, nothing broken. The dr said that I might have an inflamation for maybe carrying my daughter who was 6 months at the time. He said that I should rest, gave me hidrocodone for the pain and sent me home. For a month, the most horrible time I've experienced I was miserable, my family litterally would take me to the bathroom, wash me , take me to even do pipi everything, sitting in the toilet was the worst while my husband would hold me. Finally after a month and half I started walking but slowly. It went away for 6 months and then I've started having pain in there almost everymonth non stop for 2 years. The pain is not like the first time but its really unconfortable, most days I cannot do anything. I know I should see an especialist but I'd like to know what could this be.

{"ques": " About two days ago, I started getting these weird back pains. They are in my lower back and on both sides. It's not like an inside \"guts\" pain, or even muscle pain. It's more of a joint, bone, pain. (I think) I'm not sure, but it hurts sooo bad. It gets worse when I bend over to pick something up off of the ground. Even when I go to the bathroom, it hurts when I \"try\" to go #2. At first I thought this was because I should be starting my period soon (tommorow). The first day of the back pains, I also had severe cramps. It felt like my ovaries literally EXPLODED. It was so bad. Now this whole time, (with both pains) I've also had THE WORST headaches of my life. Like, the \"if I lay down I'm okay but if I sit or stand I might as well be dying\" kind of head aches. And they just pound uncontrollably. Now I barely slept at all last night because of these pains, so this morning I took some excedrin extra strength. IT WORKED WONDERS!! However, I knew EXACTLY when it wore off. The back pain was back, headache, but this time, no cramps. Those have left to never be seen again.  \r\nI have no idea if all of this is linked or not, but all of it starting at once, its really taking a toll on me. I work in a factory where it can sometimes reach up to 100 degrees, (and dont say im dehydrated, I literally drink 9 bottles of gatorade in 8 hours).  \r\n \r\nSomebody please tell me you can help, I've been balling my eyes out, and I don't want to ruin my body with excedrin, or feel like im addicted to it because its the only thing that takes the pain away.

{"ques": " Lets start with square 1... lol. Back in 2010, I went to my OBGYN for sharp pains in my ovaries, along with really bad tailbone pain. I had cysts on my ovaries. So she watched them for a few weeks and they began to go away. She found a fibroid on my uterus, so I had a laproscopy to find out that my left ovary was fused to my colon, and my ovary/tube was basically mush. She cut as much tissue as she could without cutting blood vessels. This provided me with releif for about 6 months. I began having the tailbone pain again, just not as bad.  \r\n    So with this going on since then, about  months ago,  I have had this very strong/stiff lower back ache. And it was like when I had the strong pain, it radiates down my right leg. Mostly when I go to get up, or when I am NOT moving around. After 2 weeks of this, I went to the ER one evening because I became very dizzy and kept feeling like I was going to pass out. I was diagnosed with vertigo, and sciatic nerve pain. So when I saw my primary doc 2 days later, he ordered a CT for my head, and an MRI on my spine.  After 2 weeks of waiting on those results, I go in, and he tells me CT was fine, hasnt a clue why I had gotten vertigo. (I was in a bad accident at 16, about 6 years ago,) and had vertigo, and Ive heard you can get it again once youve had it.) thats all he could relate it to. Then he tells me the results of my MRI,  \"Everything looks normal, other than you have arthritis in your L4, L5, which you seem a little young to have. (Also fractured my l4 l5 in accident.)   once he said the results of this, he said take some Ibprofen and left the room.   ?????????????? \r\n \r\n     Knowing I should have been like, WAIT A MINUTE! I need this resolved, I didn't. I left. Upset because the test didn't show anything. And what it did show, he didn't seem too concerned about. Me being me, I just got upset and figured I'd just have to live with the pain. So for a few months now, I have been. But just today, it is flaring back up like WOW. Like Its hitting me for the first time again. I am afraid its something serious, but if it was, wouldnt the MRI of showed something????? \r\n \r\n    I am done with this pain. I want it figured out. Him not giving me any answers, I began to think, maybe this could all be related to my reproductive organ issue? So I made an appt with my OBGYN again, first time since my laproscopy. Im due for my yearly anyways. Im actually a year past due.  \r\n \r\n   But I'm going to ex out sciatic pain, considering it didn't show on the MRI. As far as \"arthritis\" he didnt seem to concerned, so should I even worry about it? And, has any wemon ever had any of these symptoms related to their ovaries/uterus/ect??   \r\n \r\n    I just need some answers... and experience would be greatly appreciated.

{"ques": " I am a male in my early-30s, about 80lbs overweight. About 3 weeks ago I noticed some pain in my lower back after having vacuumed and climbed onto a 3 foot platform. There was no sudden onset; it just gradually developed.  \r\n \r\nFor the first 10 or so days it was only mild pain. As long as I did not stand for extended periods of time, I barely noticed it. Then, I started experiencing pain from doing normal things like getting into and out of bed or trying to put on socks. More recently, in the last week or so, the pain has become more severe, to the point that I can only stand for about 60 seconds without pain and when I switch positions (especially after standing for more than a couple minutes), the pain is so intense that I grimace and breathe heavily for about 30 seconds until the pain subsides. Once I am back in the sitting position, particularly in a desk chair leaning forward with my elbow resting on the desk, the pain usually returns to a manageable level within a few minutes. \r\n \r\nI find that the pain is worst after lying down. I have tried many different positions, both in bed and on the couch, but I always wake up the next day with severe pain. When the pain is more severe, it shoots outward from my spine toward my lower-left back and left hip. I have not had any issues on the right side. \r\n \r\nI have had back issues in the past. About 15 years ago I hurt this same area of my back while lifting a 50lb item at an after-school job. I was on light/sitting duty for several weeks and it eventually went away. Since then, I have experienced mild to moderate pain in the same area when I run or stand in place for an extended period. It was usually not an issue when walking. \r\n \r\nAny thoughts on what is going on or what I can do to heal? Obviously I need to lose weight. Is my weight likely the cause or aggravation to what I am currently experiencing?

I'm  more looking for personal experience stories than anything else on here - hopefully some success stories after long periods of pain with similar cause or symptoms as mine to give me some mental comfort.  \r\n \r\nAnyway, here's the situation: I'm 25, fairly fit and active, and I hurt my lower back at the gym about 7 months ago. Not sure exactly what exercise caused it because the pain started the day after, but the likely culprit is hyperextending my back doing back extensions. It started with very sharp stabbing pains initially, then turned into a constant duller ache that has not gone away ever since. The pain level isn't high and is localized to my lower back, but in 7 months I can count on my fingers the number of pain-free days. \r\n \r\nThe pain consistently gets worse when I sit still or stand still for periods over an hour, and can usually be relieved to the point of no pain by lying down or with exercise (I use the elliptical machine and do stability exercises only now - nothing that jars the back). Unfortunately I have a desk job. \r\n \r\nX-ray and MRI show nothing wrong with me. But given the amount of time that has passed by, and that the pain on average hasn't gotten better at all, I'm becoming extremely worried and depressed as this is taking me away from certain social activities I love, such as board gaming.  \r\n \r\nAnyway, does anyone of similar age and health have similar stories of low back pain? Did it eventually heal on its own, and how long did it take you?

So when I went back to practice that morning all we did was spiking drills and digging. I got an extreme pain in my whole back, it tightened up and I couldn't walk without almost breaking down. I iced my back for 2 hours now knowing my stupid self I went back to the later practice that afternoon. When we played games with the varsity, I went up for a spike and my back started hurting again so I started to cry and had to sit out. My season is coming up in 5 weeks, plus I have camp starting Monday. I've gone to a chiropractor and I've been taking Aleve and Tylenol. But sometimes painkillers don't even help the pain.

{"ques": " Since July I've had lower back pain that just doesn't seem to want to go away. It seems to be low-back, almost the top of my butt also - both left and right of the spine, not so much the spine itself. Pain is not shooting down my leg, so I'm pretty sure it's not sciatica. I'm a pretty active individual, whether it be playing football, basketball, baseball, and stuff like that, but my real passion is reenacting medieval battles. My fighting style involves alot of spinning. \r\n     In late July I went to the Doc with this problem, and I was perscribed Ibprofen and Flexeril (muscle relaxer) - neither of these did anything other than make me slightly buzzed. \r\n     On my second visit to the Doc in late August I was then refered to physical therapy. After about 5 visits or so the the PT my pain did seem to go away. I asked him if I could try my medieval fighting, and he said go for it. Pain instantly came back upon my fighting. \r\n     Now I'm at a Chiro. Not working either.

{"ques": " When I do straight-leg sit-ups (basically it's when you lay completely flat to do situps/crunches), i feel lower-back pain. Likely it's the muscle not the spine, as it feels like the pain is from my lower-back muscle. I don't know if it's my lower-spine or just the muscle. \r\n \r\nBut I read somewhere that it could be that I'm doing them wrong, like either the posture or putting more stress on my lower-back than I need to. Back when I went to school, I didn't feel the sharp lower-back pain that I do now, because we had a buddy-system where someone would hold our feet when we did them. \r\n \r\nSince now I try to exercise by myself, I don't have anybody to hold my feet so I try to hold myself down up against the bottom of the couch or against the wall, which doesn't seem to help that much but it works better than nothing.  \r\n \r\nSo my question comes to, if I were to do something like strapping my legs down to relieve some of the pressure/tension on my lower-back trying to keep my legs down, as if someone was holding my feet down, should the pain I feel in my lower-back go away?

{"ques": " Hi everyone, \r\n \r\nIn mid-August, my back went \"out.\" I was laid up in bed almost every evening, though mornings seemed to be easier going. Doctor ordered an MRI--unfortunately he ordered it for my cervical spine and it came back negative, even though my pain is located in mid to lower back. He detected slight scoliosis and my physical therapists confirmed that my ribs are flared and there is asymmetry in my back. Went to therapy from August-November and saw mild improvement but not enough. I was still having to crawl around in the evenings to get from place to place. In mid-to-late November, I saw my chiropractor a couple of times. I felt relief after but the pain always came back. I also started seeing an LMT. Perhaps the most telling thing was that she asked me to turn my head from side to side--no problem (not cervical). She asked me to turn my body from side to side--no problem (not thoracic). She then asked me to touch my toes and I could barely bend forward (definitely lumbar). The LMT helped relieve a lot of the muscle tension that's been mounting.  \r\n \r\nMy insurance changed between October and December--meaning I can no longer get help for my spine as it is a pre-existing condition. However, my new doctor prescribed lorazepam which, paired with massages, seems to help with relaxing the muscles and easing the anxiety caused by the chronic pain. I'm at least able to walk now, and there's only been one or two evenings in the last couple of weeks that I had to crawl. \r\n \r\nThe pain is still with me, though, and I'm wondering if it's normal for lower back pain to last five months. The anxiety my pain and my stressful living situation are causing is telling me it's something serious, and when the pain spreads to my shoulders and chest I worry it's something heart-related (but I've had blood tests, two EKGs, a chest x-ray and even a test where they injected a fluid to make sure my cardiovascular system was operating properly and nothing came up).  \r\n \r\nShould I be worried that my pain is something more serious than something caused by poor posture and too much computer time? How long into chronic lower back pain do you expect to get better?", "link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20121226151327AAyY9xr", "cate": " Pain & Pain Management", "title": "\n            Chronic lower back pain?\n        "},

I squatted heavy and I was fine, but then I did the bent over long bar rows again and hurt my back again *headslap* (never doing those again). So then yesterday I knew squatting would hurt my back, so I did other things.

Okay, how I hurt my back is stupid, but here it goes.....I had surgery on my wrist April 23, 2012 for a thing called Kienbock's Disease and my radius had to be shortened. With that happening, my wrist has never been the same since and really hurts at times and I can't put pressure on it. So one day, I'm outside with my friends and I decide to do a one handed push-up. It would have been fine, except I was on gravel. With this, it started to dig into my hand and made it hurt so I went to sit down. When I sat down I did this sorta really quick twist/sit down with my back. I didn't think anything of it and it didn't hurt right after it. The next day, I'm sitting on the couch slightly bent over and when I stand up to walk, my back hurt a lot. Oh yeah, it's on my right side of the lower back. Since then, I have a lot of pain bending over, bending backwards, twisting, and flexing my back muscles. I went to physical therapy for almost two months and nothing really seemed to get better. It almost seemed like it made it worse. (At physical therapy they said something about something being out of place but I can't remember). I should be going to the doctor in a few weeks and will get an MRI. I also get some pain in my thigh on the outside to front a little bit. I didn't know if it could be a herniated disc or not. Is there a possibility of surgery too? It has been four months and physical therapy didn't help. And I'm not doing acupuncture because I can't stand needles.

It hurts when I sit up, or if I were to try and touch my toes. A couple years back a doctor said my back was too curved.

Do you have any idea what I could have or done, and if there is something I can do? \r\n \r\n2.

I recently joined my highschool tennis team and have been doing tennis for about 3 weeks now. I am right handed so I use my racket in my right hand.

{"ques": " Hello everyone, \r\nI am a 20 year old male. \r\n \r\nI have had low back pain for about four months now, and now I am having lower abdomen pain. \r\nI have been to the doctor a few times (Urgent Care), but this upcoming Monday I will have an official appointment. \r\nThe doctor I went to believes it is a Lumbar disk problem, and it makes sense because when I bend backward, pain shoots down my right leg, so I'm pretty sure it is a nervous system issue, not a muscular one. \r\nIt's also worth mentioning that this Low back pain is the type that makes it impossible for you to bend forward. \r\n \r\nHowever, with my lower abdomen, I feel discomfort now. Every time I urinate, it is slightly painful when the urine flows out, and then my lower abdomen discomfort increases a bit. I had a urine test and the doctor said my urine was clean, and he tested to see if my prostate was swollen, which it wasn't. My testicles also do not seem swollen in any way... So he simply said to wait it out to see what happens. \r\n \r\nI am really starting to think that my lower back pain and lower abdomen pain are related, perhaps the former is culprit for the latter? And if so in what way? I had lower back pain way before the abdomen pain so it makes sense. \r\n \r\nIf anyone has similar issues or has any idea what may be going on, that will be helpful, thanks!", "link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120425175026AAsjaqA", "cate": " Pain & Pain Management", "title": "\n            Low back pain/Low abdomen pain?\n        "},

The pain does ease as I start to move around but never completely goes although it does become more and more manageable throughout the day.

But if so why do I hurt so much?? I have had x-rays that showed mild scoliousus of the lower thuritac lumbar, and the ER DR that did the x-rays refuted me to the family Dr and told me I most likely needed an MRI. I stated all of this to the family doctor, but all he did was give me an anatomy lesson about the disks and nerves, and what causes the pain. Then he told me that MRI are not cheap. He didn't order one on me, just gave me a weeks supply of vicoden ES, that was like a week before x-mass, I ran out , and haven't been able to get a refill due to the holidays and new years, because he didn't work, so I went today (Monday) and was told he was still out because he had his gaulblatter removed. \r\nI'm not trying to get pain meds, well in a way I am, but I just want the pain to stop. I have insurance, and there is no reason I should have to be in pain. I don't know what to do. If there was something other than drugs to remove the pain I would say let's go for it, but he was telling me I'm to young to need surgery and to young to be on meds. He don't wanna order an MRI.

{"ques": " I really dont know what could be occurring or why but i'd like some advice.  \r\n \r\nAbout a year ago when i started my first job a problem developed. When i would put weight on my left leg i would get this strange grinding feeling in what felt like the back of my thigh and it would give out on me and not to mention it hurt to the point i was scared to walk on it. Every since then it eased off and it got to be okay for me to walk on and use normally but when i would be up on my feet for 5-8 hours and i would go home and sit down it would throb a little and become quite stiff. If i rested for a little while it would ease off and become normal and then a little after a year later i've started to have incredibly painful lower back pains. If i stand up i get a piercing pain in my lower back that seems to travel down and cause pain in the same area as the troubled spot from a year ago. I'm not quite sure what could be wrong. I thought maybe the leg pain was trouble from my hip, however with the lower back pain it now causes me trouble to bend over or sit for a long amount of time. Even standing causes me trouble. It seems like the only time i'm pain free is if im laying down. I understand i should go to the dr but right now i've not only lost my job but i have no insurance.

{"ques": " - First off, I am an 18 year old female. \r\n \r\n- This pain occurs only maybe about 3 to 5 times a year since 2003, but I hadn't experienced this issue since 2010...until this morning after I woke up, but hadn't eaten or drank anything yet. \r\n \r\n- I get an intense pain in the center of my lower back, & it feels as if the pain is spread across the entire lower back right to the sides of the back area, but I don't feel pain anywhere in the front of my body or in any other area other than this \"lower back from the side-to-side area\", basically. \r\n \r\n- I often feel suddenly warm, slightly light-headed, & I breathe a littler harder when the pain is occurring & I am too uncomfortable to want to move; though if I really really wanted to, I would be able to walk around & stand if necessary, but I'd rather not move until the pain subsides. \r\n \r\n- I've experienced this exact kind of pain on several occasions in several geographical locations. Whether it be from after running around outside all day & then stopping & then getting hit by the pain, OR from doing absolutely nothing at all all day long & suddenly feeling the pain. \r\n \r\n- I've never had any eating disorder or problems, or allergies. & I've maintain a balanced intake of food my entire life. However, my entire life I have daily experiences where I feel like I may pass out after standing up too quickly or after standing too long. \r\n \r\n- I have not been diagnosed with any kidney issues, though I've never been tested for any kidney issues either. \r\n \r\n- I do NOT have history of any back problems. I have never broken a bone, or pulled a muscle or anything like that ever. & I do not have any known health issues. \r\n \r\n- I've felt this exact type of pain since I was 8 years old (this is not an estimation, this is accurate). I have visited my general practitioner & told him about these pains before, but he thinks it's been associated with puberty & like menstrual cycle stuff, but I did not start the cycle until age 13, and I've never experienced the back pain as a common monthly occurrence or anytime during my period. \r\n \r\n- I'm about 5 foot 6 & somewhere between 135 lbs - 140 lbs, not over or underweight, and able to pull my body weight from a standing position fully upward into a chin up with ease. & I am able to do prolonged physical activity, like literally running anywhere from just 20 minutes to 4 hours, without feeling the back pain. So this is not a weight issue. \r\n \r\n- I have played a variety of sports for nearly my entire life. I do not work out or play sports excessively though! & I have never passed out while playing one. & when I am doing physical activity I do not feel any pain like I'm straining myself or anything. \r\n \r\n- Is this pain possibly associated with the kind of bed I sleep on? Or the position(s) I sleep in? \r\nOr possibly dehydration? \r\n \r\n- & one last point I want to make is that I have actually not done any physical activity for about a week. \r\n \r\nI am just seeking advice or any guesses, I'm not too worried obviously, or I would've probably got an x-ray or MRI by now. Just wondering if anyone can relate to me with this problem or if they actually know that this is likely because of a certain cause.

Not exactly sure.   \r\nQuestions: \r\nIs this a UTI, kidney infection, sign of kidney stones? \r\nIs it really worth going to hospital (pain is that bad, but not sure if I should go)? \r\nAny advice?....", "link": "https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120522132248AAa2ic9", "cate": " Pain & Pain Management", "title": "\n            Lower (left) back pain?\n        "},

It also hurts when i sit for periods of time when i watch tv an stay in one position straight up. I have had minor back pain before that went away an one day at work i stepped the wrong way which 15mins later had me on the ground in tears. Then needing help with a cane i was able to walk the pain isnt as bad as that day an normally the only time it feels good is when im laying straight on my back but now even on my side or stomach has been hurting it. Which i find really weird is when i sit at a resturant i can bring my legs to a full straight position without it bothering me an the fact that when i sneeze it hurts a lot. I really do not know what it could be i do play video games but i also work construction so i know im getting time away from sitting around all day. from what im told maybe a pinched nerve. Also when i rub it the pain goes away alittle bit. Sometimes even sitting in the bathroom can be a task or doing dishes. Ive been taking it easy for the last 3 weeks just relaxing but sometimes it feels like it gets worse doing nothing i really do not wanna go to the doctors just for them to tell me its in my head or just give me pain pills i wanna be fixxed so i can get back to doing normal things without feeling like if i twist to fast my backs gonna break or something.

I used to be able to walk on a flat surface with little discomfort even when the pain would flare up....

I am walking slowly and awkwardly to compensate.  \r\n \r\nI haven't really had any kind of pain like this before... but I feel like an old person. I frequently have to squat to reach things on low shelves at work, and lift up to 40-50 pounds of flour/batter.

{"ques": " I have been suffering from back pain for a few years now. I am only 25 years old but have done some crazy things and worked very hard. I am not to sure when and where I actually hurt myself, but I know it def. has hurt for quite some time now. I have been to a few hospitals because of it. One saying that I had sciatica and lower back pain. The others just giving me xrays and sending me home. I want to a chiropractor and had an xray done and a few movement test done with him. He said he could def. tell me I have a herniated lumbatr disk but couldnt refer me to get the right test  because of my insurance. So I went to the doctor in my small town and started seeing him for it and was put on Tramadol and Phentermine for pain and nausea. It helped but not to well. I asked him to put me on something stronger and he started winging me off the tramadol after like 2 mo. To not put me on anything for it but diagnose me with chronic low back pain. No referal to go get any further tests done. So I stoped seeing him and have had a few other er visits. To not get anything done. I have the tingeling, fire to pain, pain to fire, feeling in my legs all the time. My left mostly. Pain that comes and goes but mostly comes. It feels like after doing anything physical or sometimes just the slowest thing that you wouldnt ever think would hurt you. The bottom of my back feels like it tightens up. I get pains that shoot into my kidney areas it feels like. Hip pains. Just a whole bunch of crazy things. I have been dealing with this for about 3 years now. I have a doc app. coming up with a internist and am hoping to get the proper tests and maybe be put on an actual pain med that helps. otc def dont do anything.
